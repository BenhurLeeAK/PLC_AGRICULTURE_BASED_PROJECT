PLC Automation Project – TIA Portal V14

Overview
This project is developed in TIA Portal V14 for a Siemens S7-1200 (1214C AC/DC/Relay PLC) with:
1 x 12-bit Analog Module
HMI Interface for Control & Monitoring

The project features two industrial automation applications:

1.Water Irrigation System
 Silos Grain Storage System
  1️.Water Irrigation System
  Inputs are provided via memory bits, which can be accessed and modified through the HMI interface.
  Inlet and Outlet motors are controlled to regulate water flow based on conditions.

  Level Sensors:
   Empty Level Sensor
   Half Level Sensor
   Full Level Sensor

 2️.Silos Grain Storage System
  Uses a digital input for the let-out lid control.

 Analog inputs include:
  Ultrasonic sensor (for level monitoring).
  Humidity sensor (to maintain optimal storage conditions).
  
 Dehumidifier to maintain proper grain storage conditions.
